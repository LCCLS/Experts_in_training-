Please put the notebooks for Assignment 3a and 3b as well as the Python modules (files ending with .py) in one folder, which you call ASSIGNMENT_3_FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME.

    "In this assignment, you will first complete a number of small exercises about each chapter to make sure you are familiar with the most important concepts. In the second part of the assignment, you will apply your newly acquired skills to write your very own text processing program (ASSIGNMENT-3b) :-).

Please determine where the notebook or Python module that you are working with is located on your computer. Try to determine where Python is looking if you provide a path such as “../Data/lyrics/walrus.txt”. Try to go from your notebook to the location on your computer where Python is trying to find the file. One tip: if you did not store the Assignments notebooks 3a and 3b in the folder “Assignments”, you would get this error.\n",

Write a function called `replace_walrus`, which takes lyrics as input and replaces every instance of 'walrus' by 'hippo' (make sure to account for upper and lower case - it is fine to transform everything to lower case). The function should write the new version of the song to a file called 'walrus_hippo.txt and stored in ../Data/lyrics. \n",
